My name is Pedro Vaz Pimenta and I have a BSc in Mathematics from the University of São Paulo (USP), Institute of Mathematics and Statistics (IME). I am interested in data analysis, big data, large language models, computer vision, and natural language processing. 

My knowledge includes mathematical modeling (linear and nonlinear optimization, combinatorial optimization, operation research), data analysis (data visualization, data cleaning, machine learning, regular expressions, deep learning), statistics (descriptive statistics, probability, distributions, law of large numbers, estimators and hypothesis tests), and programming (object oriented programming, clean code, logical programming, statistical programming, PEP 8).

My experience includes regression models, fuzzy search, fuzzy clustering, fuzzy word matching, RegEx patterns, risk and confidence analysis, text geoparsing, data visualization, ML-Ops, backend, computer vision(image classification and segmentation), natural language processing(tokenization, word embeddings, part of speech parsing, text classification, question and answer, generative models, named entity recognition, large language models) and deep learning in general. 

My programming languages are Python, R, C/C++, Prolog, ProbLog, LaTeX, and MySQL and the technologies I know and work with include NumPy, Pandas, MatplotLib, SciKit-Learn, Pytorch, Keras, Tensorflow, OpenCV, GIT, Docker, Flask, Celery, AWS S3 (boto3), Azure Dev-Ops, Scrum, Transformers, BERT (and BERT based models), OpenAI API.
