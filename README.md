I'm mathematics student at IME-USP (expect to graduate at the end of the year) with solid knowlege of mathematical modeling and data analysis, and a good understanding of statistics and some programming languages (Python, R and C/C++). Right now I'm looking for jobs related to Data Science, Data Analysis and Python Development.
